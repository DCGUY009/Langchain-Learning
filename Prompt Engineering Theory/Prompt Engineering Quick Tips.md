# ⚡ Quick Tips for Writing Better Prompts

To write a good prompt, you should focus on the following key elements:

---

### ✅ 1. **Context**
Context helps the LLM understand the **role, domain, and scenario**, which leads to more accurate outputs.

#### 📌 Example

**Prompt:**
> Generate a list of technical interview questions for a senior DevOps Engineer position in a tech start-up with fast-paced culture working in the cloud

Let’s break this prompt down to identify contextual cues:

#### 🔹 **Role-Specific Context**
**"Senior DevOps Engineer"**
- Implies deep technical experience.
- Needs to cover CI/CD, automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, observability, etc.
- Leadership and mentorship responsibilities may be expected.

#### 🔹 **Company Type Context**
**"Tech start-up"**
- Resource-constrained and high-growth environment.
- Emphasis on versatility, ownership, and the ability to wear multiple hats.
- Preference for engineers who can make fast decisions and implement scalable solutions quickly.

#### 🔹 **Cultural Context**
**"Fast-paced culture"**
- Prioritizes agility, adaptability, and speed of execution.
- Focus on iterative development and rapid deployments.
- Candidates should be comfortable with ambiguity and shifting priorities.

#### 🔹 **Technology Stack Context**
**"Working in the cloud"**
- Suggests questions focused on cloud-native architectures.
- Expect proficiency in platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- Includes scalability, reliability, cost optimization, and security in cloud environments.

### ✅ **Summary for Question Design**
When generating interview questions, make sure they:
- Test **deep DevOps knowledge** and **hands-on skills**.
- Reflect **startup readiness**: flexibility, pragmatism, and a bias for action.
- Assess **cloud expertise** and understanding of scalable architectures.
- Evaluate **soft skills** relevant to fast-moving environments: communication, prioritization, and autonomy.

**Prompt (with context considered):**  
> Generate a list of technical interview questions for a senior DevOps Engineer position in a tech start-up with fast-paced culture working in the cloud

**Response:**

### 🛠️ **Core DevOps & Automation**
1. How would you design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application?  
2. Describe your approach to implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). What tools do you prefer and why?  
3. How do you manage secrets and sensitive data in CI/CD pipelines?  
4. What’s your process for troubleshooting a failing deployment?  

---

### ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & Operations**
5. Describe a production architecture you’ve built on AWS/GCP/Azure. What were the key trade-offs?  
6. How do you approach high availability and fault tolerance in cloud-native applications?  
7. What are your go-to strategies for cloud cost optimization?  
8. How do you secure cloud infrastructure at scale?  

---

### 🐳 **Containers & Orchestration**
9. What are the pros and cons of using Docker vs. containerd?  
10. Describe your experience with Kubernetes. How have you handled upgrades or cluster scaling?  
11. How would you debug a pod stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`?  
12. What’s your approach to managing Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests in a growing team?  

---

### 📈 **Monitoring, Observability & Incident Response**
13. How do you define SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets in a start-up setting?  
14. Which tools have you used for centralized logging and monitoring?  
15. Describe a major incident you resolved—what happened, and how did you handle it?  
16. How do you reduce alert fatigue while maintaining visibility into system health?  

---

### 🧠 **Strategy, Culture & Leadership**
17. How would you introduce DevOps best practices in a start-up that previously lacked formal processes?  
18. How do you prioritize DevOps tasks in a high-pressure, release-driven environment?  
19. How do you mentor junior engineers on topics like CI/CD or infrastructure management?  
20. What do you do when engineers push code that bypasses pipeline policies?  

> 📝 **Takeaway**: The more **contextually relevant** the prompt, the **more accurate and useful** the output.

---

### ✅ 2. **Clear, Non-Ambiguous Task**

If you’re not specific with what you want, the LLM has to **guess your intent**, which often leads to suboptimal results.

#### ⚠️ Vague Prompt:
> Improve the user experience of our e-commerce website

#### ✅ Clear, Specific Prompt:
> Identify and address specific pain points in the user experience of our e-commerce website to increase customer satisfaction and sales conversion rates

> 📝 **Takeaway**: A clear task gives the model **focus**, helping it generate **targeted** and **relevant** outputs.

---

### ✅ 3. **Iterate for Improvement**

Iterating is crucial in **prompt engineering**.

- Start simple  
- Test the response  
- Refine the prompt  
- Repeat until the output is what you need  

> 💡 Think before you prompt. Clarity upfront saves effort later.
