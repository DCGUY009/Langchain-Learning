# üõ†Ô∏è LLM Operations (LLMOps)

When building and deploying **LLM-powered applications**, it‚Äôs not just about writing a prompt and hitting "run." There‚Äôs a full **lifecycle** to manage:

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Does LLMOps Involve?

1. **Prompt Management**  
   - Iterating and experimenting to find what works.
   - Adjusting prompts per **LLM vendor** (what works on OpenAI might not on Anthropic).
   - Keeping track of prompt versions and performance.

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track **latency**, **cost**, **token usage**, etc.
   - Understand application performance over time.

3. **Debugging**
   - When things go wrong, you need to inspect the **LLM calls**, prompt structure, and outputs.
   - Helps find why responses aren‚Äôt accurate or tasks are failing.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluating if the LLM's response is **accurate**, **helpful**, and **safe**.
   - Automating evals is essential for scale.

## üß∞ Tools for LLMOps

- üîç [**LangSmith**](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)  
  A powerful tool for:
  - Prompt versioning
  - LLM call tracking
  - Debugging chains
  - Evaluation pipelines  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not open-source** ‚Äì your data lives on their servers. Consider privacy implications.

- üêß [**Pezzo (Open-source)**](https://www.pezzo.ai/)  
  - Lightweight, self-hostable alternative
  - Good for smaller teams or privacy-conscious applications

## üõ°Ô∏è LLM Security

Once your GenAI app is in production, security becomes **critical**.  
These are the top threats you must guard against:

### üîê Common Threats:
- **Prompt Injection**  
- **Jailbreaking**  
- **Abusive Content** (hate, profanity, toxicity)  
- **PII Leakage** (Personal Identifiable Information)  
- **Insecure Tooling/API Access**

### üîß Mitigation Measures:

- üß™ **LangChain Experimental Modules**  
  LangChain has migrated vulnerable features into the `langchain_experimental` module for safer dev.

- üîÑ **Guardrails and Moderation**  
  Add validation, filter untrusted inputs, and integrate moderation APIs (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, custom rules).
