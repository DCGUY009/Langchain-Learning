# 🔐 Using Managed LLMs: Privacy and Data Retention

Before integrating LLMs into your organization, ask these critical questions:

1. ❓ Is the data sent in prompts used for **training**?
2. 🕒 How long is the **data retained**?
3. 🎯 What are the **purposes** for retention?
4. 📝 Who owns the **copyright** of generated content?
5. ⚠️ Other legal and privacy-related concerns...

## 📃 Read the EULA & TOS

Every LLM vendor provides:
- **EULA (End User License Agreement)**
- **TOS (Terms of Service)**

📌 These documents explain how your data is handled. Always **review them** before adopting LLMs in your workflows.

## 🔁 1. Model Training & Data Retention

As of **March 1, 2023**, OpenAI states:

> “**Data sent via the OpenAI API is not used to train models** by default.”  
🔗 [OpenAI Data Privacy Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data)

- You can **opt-in** to data sharing if you choose.
- API data is **retained for 30 days** (for abuse detection) and then deleted.

## 🏥 Industries with High Privacy Requirements

Some industries — like:

- **Healthcare**
- **Banking**
- **Defense**

...have strict **privacy and compliance regulations**.

➡️ For this reason, they **do not use managed LLMs** (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Instead, they:
- **Host open-source LLMs** on their own infrastructure (e.g. Mistral, LLaMA, etc.)
- Or, use **private cloud-hosted** LLMs with strict security enforcement.

✅ This shifts **infrastructure responsibility** to the cloud provider but allows full control over security policies.

> 🧠 Bottom Line:  
Understand your **data lifecycle, legal obligations, and compliance posture** before putting LLMs into production environments — especially in regulated sectors.
