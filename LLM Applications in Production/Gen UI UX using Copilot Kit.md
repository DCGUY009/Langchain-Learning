# 🧑‍💻 Generative UI/UX Using CopilotKit

When developing GenAI applications, we often build robust **backend systems** to manage:
- State
- Memory
- API calls
- Tool integrations

But integrating all of that into a **clean, interactive frontend** can be a challenge — especially for backend-focused developers.

## 🎯 Enter **CopilotKit**

**CopilotKit** is an open-source **generative UI library** that helps build intuitive and production-ready frontends for GenAI apps with minimal effort.

It offers:
- 📦 Pre-built **hooks** and **components**
- ⚡ Seamless integration with LLM agents
- 🧠 Support for **LangGraph agents** (memory, state, human-in-the-loop)

This allows you to focus on your backend logic while CopilotKit takes care of the frontend complexity — including agent interactions, prompt injection, and rendering flows.
