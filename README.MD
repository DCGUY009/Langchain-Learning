### **Setting Up Pipenv for Multiple Subfolders with Isolated `.venv` Environments**

This is how to ensure that each subfolder has its own **Pipenv virtual environment** stored inside the subfolder (`.venv`), making it easy to distinguish environments. When activated, the environment name (same as the subfolder) will appear in parentheses before the terminal path.

---

#### **1. Remove Any Root-Level Pipenv Configuration (If Applicable)**  
If your root project folder contains a `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock`, Pipenv might try to associate all subfolders with the same virtual environment. To prevent this:
- **Delete** `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` from the root manually.
- Or, if a virtual environment is already linked, remove it using:
  ```bash
  pipenv --rm
  ```

---

#### **2. Create a Separate Virtual Environment in Each Subfolder**  
Navigate to the subfolder where you want to create an isolated virtual environment and run:
```bash
cd ./subfoldername/
pipenv shell
```
This will:

✅ Create a **Pipfile** in that subfolder.  
✅ Create a `.venv` **inside** the subfolder to store dependencies.  
✅ Activate the virtual environment, displaying **(subfoldername)** before the path in the terminal.

If you want to **ensure the `.venv` is created inside the subfolder**, set:
```powershell
$env:PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT = "1"
```
and then activate the pipenv shell:
```powershell
pipenv shell
```
Sometimes running the above 2 commands together works in creating the venv effectively.
```powershell
$env:PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT = "1"
pipenv shell
```

#### **3. Activating the Virtual Environment in Any Subfolder**  
Once inside the subfolder, activate its virtual environment with:
```powershell
./.venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows (PowerShell)
```
This ensures the correct environment is used, and the terminal prompt should update to show `(subfoldername)` before the path.

---

#### **4. Switching Between Subfolder Environments**
1. **Deactivate the current environment** before switching:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
2. **Navigate to another subfolder and activate its environment:**
   ```bash
   cd ../another-subfolder/
   ./.venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   ```

---

#### **5. Verify the Active Virtual Environment**
To confirm which virtual environment is currently active:
```powershell
pipenv --venv
```
This should return the path inside the current subfolder:
```
Folder Path\subfoldername\.venv
```

To further verify:
```powershell
echo $env:VIRTUAL_ENV  # PowerShell
```
This should match the `.venv` inside the current subfolder.

---

#### **6. Notes on Virtual Environment Naming**
- The environment name displayed in parentheses **before the path** (`(subfoldername)`) is auto-generated by Pipenv.
- If the folder name contains dashes (`-`), Pipenv may replace them with underscores (`_`), but the environment remains correct.

---

#### **7. Sometimes venv is not detected right**
- Sometimes some libraries even when venv is activated and the library is present in the `venv/lib` folder, it shows it can't find 
because the vscode ide is taking a different interpreter for the file.
- So, in that cases you have to enter: `ctrl + shift + p` and enter `Python: Select Interpreter` and then if you can't find the venv 
you are looking for: click on  `Enter Interpreter Path` and go to `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` in your folder where `.venv` is residing and  and choose `Select Interpreter` to resolve the issue

---

#### **Final Checklist**
✔ Each subfolder has its **own** `.venv` (not shared).  
✔ Activating the environment shows **(subfoldername)** before the terminal path.  
✔ `pipenv --venv` correctly displays the `.venv` path inside the subfolder.  
✔ Switching between environments works without conflicts.

### 🧭 Why LangGraph?

When developing agents using **LangChain (ReAct)** or simple **LLM chaining**, there are a few major pain points:

- ❌ **Unreliable execution**  
- 🔁 Can end up in **infinite loops**  
- ⚠️ Prone to **errors** due to:
  - Ambiguous task definitions  
  - Poorly defined tools  
  - Over-flexibility (leaving too much to the LLM’s discretion)  

---

### 💡 The Problem

Relying **too much on the LLM** to figure out the next action or the sequence of steps introduces unpredictability.

As developers, we often **want control** — to define:

- 🛣️ The **flow** of the agent  
- 🔄 Whether cycles are allowed  
- ✅ How each tool is used  
- 🚫 What is **not allowed** during execution  

---

### 🔗 Enter: **LangGraph**

LangGraph solves these challenges by letting you build **agent workflows as graphs**, where:

- 🔹 **Nodes** = Actions, tools, or reasoning steps  
- 🔹 **Edges** = Controlled transitions between them  
- 🔁 You can define **cycles**, but with **full control**  
- 🎯 Enables **structured agent behavior** while still using LLMs for reasoning  

> 🧠 **LangGraph = Flexibility + Reliability** — A powerful combo for robust agent systems.

### Langsmith Setup

If you want to setup Langsmith tracing for your project, follow these steps:
1. Setup env variables:
    ```bash
    LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true  # to start tracing
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = ""  # API Key created in Langsmith
    LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=Ice Breaker  # Project Name where you want tracing to happen
    ```
2. Load those environment variables in files where Agents are implemented (AgentExecutor) as vscode doesn't directly take env variables
3. Refer this documentation of setting up langsmith for more info: [Langmsith setting up](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)
4. Benefits: 
    - You will be able to trace everything from initial prompt to tool outputs etc
    - You will get a fair idea about latency, cost etc
    - You can optimize quickly based on the information present there
